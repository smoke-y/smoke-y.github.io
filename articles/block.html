            I moved away from home when I was 18 to attend university. The university is located in a city that has hot weather for most of the year and is surrounded by rocky hills that capture both rain and heat. I lived in a hostel inside the university during this time, and I came to love 1 particular block among the many. It was relatively old and did not have AC, unlike the newer blocks, yet I chose to stay in it for 2 years(at the time of writing) because of how beautifully it was designed.
            <br>

            <h2>Beating the heat</h2>

            <br>
No room faces another room. All of the rooms face inwards to the badminton courts in the middle of the block. If you walk down the hallway, on one side, you will find the doors leading to rooms, and on the other, you will find a nice view of people playing badminton. On top of each door, there is a mesh that allows for air flow from the center of the block to your room.

The block only receives direct sunlight on its left and right sides. On these sides, washrooms are placed, hence other than the rooms in the corner, none get direct sunlight to heat up. In fact, the washroom is placed in the center of the side, and it does not span the entire length. The rest of it is circular openings with a mesh on them.

            <h2>Other good stuff</h2>
            <br>

The block has 3 badminton courts, and beside the entrance, we find a tree with benches around it. There are 2 staircases, one for the rooms at the front face and one for the back face of the block. The block has only 4 floors and is very spacious. I enjoyed my time living here. I hope that in the future I can continue being surrounded by things that have been designed by people who cared about what I, as a consumer, would care about.
