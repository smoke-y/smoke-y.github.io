            "The School of Athens" is a painting in the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the Pope. It depicts many famous figures throughout history in the Academy of Athens. The central figure represents Plato, who is pointing up, and Aristotle is pointing the other way.
            <br>

<br>
To understand why this is one of the reasons this painting is renowned, we have to understand Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Plato describes people who have spent their entire lives in the cave, looking at shadows on the wall, cast by objects behind them. A man will believe that the shadow is the true form/reality until he breaks free and runs out of the cave. Plato compared attaining knowledge and wisdom to escaping the cave. He points up, in the painting, signifying the quest for the Truth, while Aristotle points downward, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.
            <br>
<br>
"The Death of Socrates" is another painting where you can observe this motif of pointing up to signify the search for the Truth. Socrates is receiving poison, after the state accused him of corrupting the youth and passed a death sentence, while he points up and pursues his students, who are in regret and denial, to never give up on the search.

<br>
There are movements against this quest, such as:
<br>
1) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings built a supercomputer, Deep Thought, to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. After 7.5 million years, it outputs: 42. The joke happens to be that the answer is 42, what is the question?
<br>
2) Absurdism: The conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the universe's inherent meaninglessness and irrationality leaves us in a state of "absurdity". Albert Camus asks us to accept/embrace it and move on with our lives. Even though Sisyphus was punished by Zeus to roll a stone to the top of a hill forever, if he accepted that his actions were inherently meaningless, he would cease to suffer, hence the phrase"one must imagine Sisyphus happy".
<br>
<br>
Before we move on, we have to define
<br>
1) Truth: Unfortunately, I don't know how to define it. I shall say: Question of Life, the Universe, Everything, and God.
<br>
2) Science: Not a body of knowledge, but a way of thinking. If the experiments say particle and wave, we accept it even though there is a contradiction.
<br>
<br>
If you have been paying attention, you would have noticed that I took the definition given by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and added "God" at the end. That's because the concept of God has been and is the Truth for most people.
<br>
<br>
For most of human history, this concept has been a depth-based approach. Mostly a 2-level hierarchy, God on the top and humans below. The Greeks have a depth of 3: Titans, Gods, and humans.
<br>
<br>
You can also choose to look at things in a spectrum.
<br>
<br>
Many people that I have talked to reject the religious view on God, and choose to view God as a higher being, a greater consciousness. You can also view it recursively. Modern entities such as "The Matrix" and Genie 3 by DeepMind provide a compelling argument that this could be possible. Each level is God to the levels below them.
<br>
<br>
The issue one faces here is that whatever belief you hold makes you act differently, hence leading to a different experience. If you are an empiricist, this is a huge problem, as these beliefs impose constraints on your actions and steer you further from the truth. If you are a rationalist, you would also face a problem, as there are countless arguments for each viewpoint of God, and you could spend a long time thinking about and cross-validating the arguments.
<br>
<br>
Hence, I suggest that all rationalists embrace empiricism until the end of the article, as the problem can be solved in an empiricist manner.  I am an empiricist because of the scientific thinking and the philosophy behind engineering, both of which lean towards empiricism. My personal experience and observation further support it. Can we walk down this path just because many motifs support it? I would say yes. The most important idea from the pre-Socratic era is the idea of an atom. How did people from an era without any scientific knowledge that we consider common come up with such an idea? Mottifs. They noticed a common recurring idea that every entity is made up of smaller entities; hence, physical matter should also be made up of smaller entities. They lacked tools to observe and pin down what these smaller entities were, but the basic idea was correct.
<br>
<br>
To observe such motifs, one has to constantly engage with new experiences. One of the well-received methods to become a generalist is to deeply engage in one field, make notes of the motifs, and engage with other fields, observing and exploiting these motifs. The more you engage with other experiences, the better you can generalize the motifs. These motifs can then be used to develop an appreciation for different ideologies. Don't be afraid to abandon and adopt new ideologies on God, life, and the answer to everything based on your new experiences. It is also ok to pick up old ideas. These motifs might not give you an exact answer, but like the Greeks behind the atom, you will have a general idea and will be closer to the Truth than someone who has less experience and hasn't noticed the motifs.
<br>
<br>
The only enemy of this religion is constraints on life that are not rational.
<br>
<br>
Now, to define "experience". An easy pitfall to avoid is the philosophy of the swine, also known as Utilitarianism. This has to be rejected because
a) It focuses on the ends rather than the means: This disengages you from deeply interacting with ideas/experiences.
b) The goals you set are highly dependent on the people around you. No deep work can be done in such a condition. To do deep work on anything, the motive has to be more internal/irrational.
<br>
<br>
Deep work, flow state, etc., whatever you want to call it. The point is that deep engagement is a must. You have to deeply care about what you are doing, and this care is always irrational.
<br>
<br>
To quote Brian Moriarty from his speech, "The Secret of Psalm 46"
<br>
"...gives rise to an extraordinary feeling a potent rare and precious emotion with the potential to completely upset your life an emotion powerful enough to make a man abandon his wife and children forfeit career and reputation lay down his possessions and follow his heart without questioning that sweet sweet Fusion of Wonder and fear irresistible attraction and soul numbing dread known as awe awe is the Grail of artistic achievement no other human emotion possesses such raw transformative power and none is more difficult to evoke few and far between are are the works of men that qualify as truly awesome it is awe that convinces a rabbi to spend a lifetime decoding Yahweh from the pentet took awe that sends millions of visitors each year to the Pyramids of Giza Guadalupe and Mecca it was awe that drove poor dilia bacon to her Doom..."
