            NOTE: The following set of articles uses the word "hacker" a lot. If you are a normie, your defenition is
            probably different from mine. Here is what I mean by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker#Definitions">hacker</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I got the idea of writing about the philosophy of hacking after I replied to a person on Twitter with the book
            "Algorithms to Live By", when the user tweeted saying that a lot of ideas present in the computational world can
            be applied to real life. The book I had suggested attempts to do something similar, but fails to convey the
            philosophy behind a hacker or an engineer.
            <br>
            <br>
            To play the devils advocate, philosophy is really hard to convey through books, especially if the reader is not
            well versed in the respective art. Take Mishima's "Sun and Steel" as an example. The book is a tough read because the
            ideas are very abstract and requires the reader to bring in their own experience in gym, martial arts, sports, etc. to
            complete the handshake.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the current CS landscape, the culture is dead. Burnt and reduced to ashes. This is not something special to this field.
            Any entity/organization, that attracts the masses is bound to kill the culture that brought the enitity from the ground
            to its prime. Middle men are constantly on the look out and nothing is free from them.
            <br>
            <br>
            The early hacker culture was about freedom. Freedom of knowledge. Freedom of speech. Freedom from rules. The current
            landscape is an exact opposite to these ideas. Hence, my first reason for writing these articles: This culture is worth
            preserving.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second reason is: This is my first "deep work" area. "deep work" is work that changes who you are at the end of it.
            It is very difficult to explain what changes, but now I have an idea. Priori. That's what changes. For readers who don't
            know what a "priori" is, there is a school of thought that says that a person's experience of an event depends on the event
            as well as their mental model/understanding of the world: Priori. That's why 2 people can undergo the same event, but
            their experience is different. They percieve the world differently. When Copernicus said that Sun is in the middle, it did
            not change anything, but also changed everything because it affected everyone's priori and they all look at the world
            differently now. These articles are a documentation of the priori that developed after my first deep work.
            <br>
            <br>
            Third reason: I have noticed a lot of good programmers come from a dysfunctional family. People you might know: Linus,
            ThePrimeagen, etc.(comment section of this <a href="https://youtu.be/VN0ueUBjeYY?si=XpXO7C63bD3yz4bK">video</a>).
            While being an amazing distractions, if the philosophy and ideas are learnt and applied to life, then we would have come
            an entire circle!
            <br>
            <br>
            These articles will be written and refined over time. I shall now leave you with this.
