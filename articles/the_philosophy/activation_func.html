            <code>y = mx + b</code> This is the equation for a straight line. You can use this equation
            to seperate/classify data. But there's an issue. For data points such as the XOR function, we can't draw a straight
            line through(try drawing a straight line which keeps all the 0's on 1 side and the 1's on the other side).
            <pre>
            <code>
                [truth table]
                0 ^ 0 = 0
                0 ^ 1 = 1
                1 ^ 0 = 1
                1 ^ 1 = 0

                [graph]
                1| 1      0
                 |
                0| 0      1
                 |__________
                  0      1
            </code>
            </pre>
            Well what if we use the equation multiple times? Such as
            <pre>
            <code>
            y<sub>1</sub> = mx + b
            y<sub>2</sub> = my<sub>1</sub> + b
            </code>
            </pre>
            This doesn't work because
            <pre>
            <code>
            y<sub>2</sub> = m(mx + b) + b
               = Mx + mb + b
               = Mx + B
            </code>
            </pre>
            It's still a single line. If we apply a non-linear function such as ReLu, we can now solve the XOR problem!
            <pre>
            <code>
            relu(x) = x if x > 0 else 0
            y<sub>1</sub> = relu(mx + b)
            y<sub>2</sub> = relu(my<sub>1</sub> + b)
            </code>
            </pre>
            As you can see, we no longer get a single straight line if we stack multiple equation when we use non-linear functions.
            These functions are called "activation functions".
            <br>
            <br>
            Non-linearity found in semi-conductors, neurons, etc. when stacked leads to interesting results. I shall now extend this
            to life. Do something everyday that is out of your comfort zone. Add some chaos to your everyday predictable day. Do
            something non-linear in your very linear day. Add some activation function to your day.
            <br>

            Wait But Why has an interesting <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html">post</a>
            that talks about how our brains gets used to changes such as buying a new car, moving to a new place, etc. So when you zoom
            out, your life looks interesting but you still feel the same way after the change as you did before. Adding an activation
            function solves this issue. Few things to be noted:
            <ul>
                <li>Don't do something you hate just because it's outside your comfort zone.</li>
                <li>You can have a group of things that you are not entirely foreign to, and these activities can be recycled. Don't forget
                to swap out old activities with new ones as soon as you start to get used to them.</li>
                <li>Doesn't have to be an outdoor activity.</li>
            </ul>
            This can also be applied when the time quantum is increased from day to month, season, year, etc.
