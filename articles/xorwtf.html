            XOR is a boolean operation that cannot be modeled by a linear regression model. This is due to the fact that a single line cannot partition the input-output graph. You always need more than 1 neuron to train an XOR function.
            <pre>
            <code>
                [truth table]
                0 ^ 0 = 0
                0 ^ 1 = 1
                1 ^ 0 = 1
                1 ^ 1 = 0

                [graph]
                1| 1      0
                 |
                0| 0      1
                 |__________
                  0      1

            This non-linear property gives rise to a lot of interesting results, such as swapping 2 numbers without a temp variable and saving space in a doubly-linked list by just storing 1 address.
            XOR is also heavily used in hashing and cryptography. To develop an intuition on the XOR operator, think of it as a bitwise "not equal to" operator.
