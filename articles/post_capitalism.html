        <h1>POST_CAPITALISM.HTML</h1>
        <h3 class="article">
            We are currently in a post-capitalistic world. Capitalism was a grand experiment, but now we are experiencing the downside. During the golden age of capitalism, products added value to our lives, no renting instead we owned the product, and most importantly we were not exploited. Technology is not fun anymore. Companies like NVIDIA limit the performance of their chip and yet sell it at a higher price. Most software services like Spotify and Netflix shove their cock between us and the artists. Fast food companies exploit our monkey brains by adding sugar and god knows what. Our bodies are filled with microplastics.

Internet and fiber optics have made data cheap. Transformers have made intelligence cheap. We can re-engineer our lives to focus on individualism and freedom. We can own stuff by understanding and hacking them. We have to go towards decentralization. Now than ever, we can do this. If you ever have a problem, the decentralized data and intelligence available can allow you to engineer your solution and share it with others.

I don't like where we are going. I most likely will never be able to own a home. I don't think the next couple of generations can. If they are renting out everything, from the songs I hear, and the videos I watch to the home I am living in, the only way out of this is by not depending on them. Right now it makes no sense. How do I use the internet to buy a home? The point I am trying to make is we as individuals should slowly start to not depend on them. Stop buying fast food. Use the internet and intelligence to come up with something that works for you. Stop buying the latest "tech". Invest your money in something that you own and is not leased. I recently moved from Windows to Linux, and good fucking lord is it a lovely experience to not have a million background tasks running. It doesn't feel like Microsoft is leaching on my machine anymore. Stop using closed-source social media. Stop giving them power. Decentralize.
