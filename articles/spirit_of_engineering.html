            Joe Barnard started BPS Space (an online shop that sells model rocketry parts) because he wanted to launch a model rocket and land it like SpaceX. Since he had no background in engineering, his initial rockets kept blowing up, and soon he could not fund his rocketry hobby. He opened BPS Space to sell parts that he designed, such as thrust vector control, rocket CPU, etc... so that he could fund his model rockets. I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ntc9QRZ-51s?si=1pfeE033-g02WTES" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech</a> by him about this process and how he learned engineering by blowing up rockets.
            If you think about it, computer science is a cheap way to learn the spirit of engineering. A program that crashed is not as expensive as a model rocket that crashed. Nor is it as difficult as finding the reason behind the crash. Since the philosophy behind both processes is the same, computer engineers learn the idea/spirit behind engineering more cost-effectively.
