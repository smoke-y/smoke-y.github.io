            IBS. A disease crafted by Satan himself. Well, here is how I learn't how to live with it-
            <h2>Forget your craving</h2>
            It's not worth it. Your only 2 metrics are a) nutrition and b) is it digestible?
            <h2>Keep track of general patterns</h2>
            My IBS flares on
            1) Changing kitchen: Whenever I go to home from hostel or go to hostel from home, my ibs flares, which
            I suppress with eldicet.
            2) Consuming non-veg: I switched to veg after I was able to digest protein shake.
            <h2>Slow introduction to food items that are not home cooked</h2>
            Never eat an entire packet of Doritos. Eat until your stomach starts getting uneasy. Wait a few days. Repeat.
            In fact, use this on any food item that you can't digest. The only exceptions would be food items that your stomach
            just doesn't want you to eat. For me it was non-veg. How does one know? Unfortunately, experience. At the time of writing,
            I have had IBS for almost an year and now I know my stomach has 2 types of uneasiness- 1)"Hey, could you just stop eating whatever
            you are eating? Im kinda having a hard time here" and 2)"wtf are you doing you idiot". Non-veg causes type 2 uneasiness and
            almost all other food falls under type 1. Type 2 uneasiness takes moths for my ibs to stop flaring and type 1 takes any where
            from few hours to days.
            <h2>Physical activity- cardio</h2>
            I lost 10KG under 4 moths. I get sick whenever I ate food that falls under type 2 uneasiness. It didn't matter.
            I ran 3k almost every day. This helped me a lot. In fact I read a research paper recomending patients with IBS to perform activities
            that increase heart rate for at least 10min.
            <h2>Doctors are not that usefull</h2>
            I got an endoscopy, colonoscopy, blood test, B12 injection, etc... At the end, the doctor just threw his hands up and said
            "Welp, I don't know". Don't get me wrong. He introduced me to tablets such as eldicet which was very usefull. But at the end
            of the day, only your observations are helpful. I remember seeing a post on the r/ibs subreddit, that anon got well after
            they started to consume anti-depressants. What. How. I researched and found out about the gut-brain theory which leads me to
            the next point-
            <h2>Gut-brain theory</h2>
            Gut-brain theory is one of the leading theories trying to explain IBS. In my experience, this theory works pretty well.
            Get 8 hours of good quality sleep every day. Stay at places that does not put mental stress even if the food you get at this
            place is not home cooked. I followed the above 2 along with cardio and staying away from food causing type 2 irritation
            and it did me wonders.
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            This diseace drained my time/energy/happiness. I spent almost half a semester at my home as a shut in, while my friends
            back at college where going out and eating whatever they wanted. Whatever. Here are my 2 cents:<br>
            1)Your'e gonna have a lot of time alone(at least I did). Use it well.<br>
