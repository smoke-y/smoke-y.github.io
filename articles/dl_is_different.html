            DL is different

            Here is why deep learning is different from traditional programming.
            
            THEORY
            1) discrete vs continuous
            DL models are continuous in nature unlike traditional program. You can get around interpretting traditional programming as a finite state machine, jumping from 1 state to another, whereas DL is continuous in nature.
            2) deterministic vs non deterministic
            Traditional programs are mostly deterministic in nature, whereas DL is non-deterministic.
            3) linear vs emerging complexity
            The complexity of traditional programs increase in a linear manner and it's doesn't give rise to interesting results, whereas DL does.

            HARDWARE
            1) serial vs parallel
            Traditional programming is mostly done on hardware designed for serial tasks, but DL needs hardware specialized for parallel tasks.
            2) design of individual core
            DL doesn't use the jmp instruction much, no need of branch prediction or any other fancy hardware circuits. All we need is low memory latency and a core with high FLOPS.
