This applies to everything. From skills that took blood, sweat, and tears to philosophy developed throughout the course of multiple events. If they are not exercised/reinforced, ideas around you provided by people around you, institutions that you are a part of, etc., are imposed upon you. Ideally, you should be part of institutions that enable you to think and act according to your will, but most of the time, they converge into an echo chamber.
<br>
<br>
How do you use your philosophies and ideas when most of your surroundings happen to be echo chambers? Engage in multiple institutes(echo chamber or idea lab) and pick out ideas that work for you from each of them. This also prevents you from getting institutionalized.
<br>
<br>
Another way to stay true to your ideas, rather than follow the crowd, is to invent metrics for what you care about. In a community, status is conferred based on who excels on the metric the community has set. When you set your own metric, you can clearly see the difference between what you want and what they want you to want. Now it is just a matter of a tradeoff.

In case you have lost it: your skill, body, etc., you can get it back relatively easily, as your brain and body have a memory that can remember after a little push from your side.
